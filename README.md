### Context
LEGO is a renowned brand of toy building bricks, often sold in sets aimed at constructing a particular object. Each set comprises numerous parts varying in shapes, sizes, and colors. This database was initially created to assist LEGO set owners in determining additional sets they could assemble with their existing pieces.

### Content
The dataset encompasses the LEGO Parts/Sets/Colors and Inventories for every official LEGO set listed in the Rebrickable database as of July 2017. For those seeking more current data or additional features, Rebrickableâ€™s API is recommended, offering up-to-date information.

### Acknowledgements
The dataset was curated by Rebrickable, a platform designed to help users identify potential LEGO sets that can be constructed from the bricks and pieces of other sets. The data is freely available for any use.
